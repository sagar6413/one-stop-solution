        - User Management: Handle user registration, authentication, and profile management.
        - Itinerary Management: Manage creation, editing, and sharing of itineraries.
        - Booking Integration: Handle integration with external booking APIs.
        - Search and Discovery: Manage advanced search functionality and personalized recommendations.
        - Reviews and Ratings: Handle the review and rating system.
    - Node.js Services:
        - Real-time Communication: Manage chat functionality and real-time notifications.
        - Social Features: Handle activity feeds, post creation, and sharing.
        - Dynamic Pricing Alerts: Manage price monitoring and alert notifications.
        - Analytics: Handle user activity tracking and generate reports
```
The service boundaries are defined based on the strengths of each technology:
- Spring Boot is used for core business logic and data-intensive operations.
- Node.js is utilized for real-time features and operations that benefit from its non-blocking I/O.
Both Spring Boot and Node.js services will communicate with each other using gRPC for efficient inter-service communication. They will also both interact with the data layer and external services as needed.

  @Cacheable(value = "userProfiles", key = "#userId")
  public UserProfile getUserProfile(String userId) {
    // Method implementation
  }
  ```
  - *Real-Time Messaging*
    - *Publish-Subscribe Model:* Use Redis Pub/Sub for real-time message broadcasting.
    - *Example Channels:* `notifications:{userId}`, `chatRoom:{roomId}`

    - Hotel Bookings
      - `GET /api/hotels/search`: Search for hotels
      - `POST /api/hotels/book`: Book a hotel
      - `GET /api/hotels/{bookingId}`: Get hotel booking details
    - Activity Bookings
      - `GET /api/activities/search`: Search for bookable activities
      - `POST /api/activities/book`: Book an activity
      - `GET /api/activities/{bookingId}`: Get activity booking details
  - Weather Service Integration
      - GET /api/weather/current`: Get current weather for a location
      - `GET /api/weather/forecast`: Get weather forecast for a location
  - Social Media Integration
    - Facebook : `POST /api/social/facebook/share`: Share a trip or post to Facebook
    - Instagram : `POST /api/social/instagram/share`: Share a photo to Instagram
    - Twitter : `POST /api/social/twitter/tweet`: Post a tweet about a trip or activity
  - General
    - All endpoints should accept and return JSON
    - Use standard HTTP status codes (200 for success, 400 for bad request, 401 for unauthorized, etc.)
    - Implement rate limiting and authentication for all endpoints
    - Use HTTPS for all communications

### ***Security Architecture***
- Design authentication and authorization system.
  - JWT-based authentication for stateless authentication
  - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for third-party authentication
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security
- Plan data encryption strategies.
  - Use of HTTPS/TLS for all client-server communications
  - Encryption at rest for sensitive data in databases
  - End-to-end encryption for chat messages
  - Encryption of sensitive files and documents

### ***Testing Strategy***

- Unit Testing Approach
  - Use of JUnit for Java and Jest for JavaScript unit tests
  - Aim for high test coverage (e.g., 80% or higher)
  - Implementation of test-driven development (TDD) practices
- Integration Testing Plan
  - Use of Spring Boot Test for testing Spring components
  - Integration tests for database operations and external service integrations
  - API integration tests using tools like Postman or REST Assured
- End-to-End Testing Strategy
  - Use of Selenium or Cypress for automated UI testing
  - Creation of critical user journey test scenarios
  - Regular execution of E2E tests in staging environment
- Performance Testing Benchmarks
  - Load testing using tools like Apache JMeter or Gatling
  - Stress testing to determine system breaking points
  - Establish performance SLAs (e.g., response times, throughput)
- Security Testing Procedures
  - Regular vulnerability scans using tools like OWASP ZAP
  - Penetration testing conducted by internal team and external security firms
  - Code security analysis using SonarQube and other static analysis tools

### ***Deployment and DevOps***

- CI/CD Pipeline Description
  - Code commit triggers pipeline in Jenkins
  - Run unit and integration tests
  - Static code analysis with SonarQube
  - Build Docker images
  - Push images to container registry
  - Deploy to staging environment
  - Run automated UI and API tests
  - Manual QA and approval
  - Deploy to production

  - Implementation of blue-green deployments for critical services
  - Use of traffic shifting for gradual rollouts
  - Automated smoke tests post-deployment

### ***Scalability and Performance***

- Load Balancing Strategies
  - Use of Kubernetes Ingress for HTTP load balancing
  - Implementation of service mesh (e.g., Istio) for advanced traffic management
  - Database read replicas for distributing read traffic
- Database Sharding Approach
  - Horizontal sharding of PostgreSQL based on user ID or geographic region
  - Use of MongoDB's native sharding capabilities for unstructured data
- Caching Strategies
  - Multi-layer caching approach:
    - Browser caching for static assets
    - CDN caching for globally distributed content
    - Application-level caching using Redis
    - Database query result caching
- Asynchronous Processing for Heavy Tasks
  - Use of Kafka for event-driven architecture and task queuing
  - Implementation of background job processors for heavy computational tasks
  - Asynchronous processing of non-critical updates and notifications

### ***Monitoring and Logging***

- Key Metrics to Monitor
  - System health metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
  - Application performance metrics (response times, error rates, throughput)
  - Business metrics (user signups, active users, bookings made)
  - Infrastructure costs and resource utilization
- Alerting Thresholds and Escalation Procedures
  - Define alerting thresholds for critical metrics
  - Implement PagerDuty or similar for on-call rotations
  - Establish escalation procedures for different severity levels
- Log Aggregation and Analysis Approach
  - Use of ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging
  - Implementation of structured logging for easier parsing and analysis
  - Regular log reviews for identifying trends and potential issues
