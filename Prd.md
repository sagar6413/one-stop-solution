    * Offer multiple authentication options to cater to diverse user preferences.
    * Enhance website security by implementing industry best practices for authentication.
    * Build a scalable and maintainable authentication service.
    * Integrate smoothly with both Next.js frontend and Spring Boot backend.

### 1.3. Target Audience

* **End-Users:** Website visitors who need to create accounts and securely access website content and features.
* **Developers:** Frontend and backend developers who will integrate and maintain the authentication service within the application ecosystem.
